# Day 7 – SQL: Related Data & Joins

## Topics Covered

### 1. A First Look At Related Data
- Understood how real-world data is spread across multiple tables.
- Learned why storing all data in a single table leads to redundancy and inconsistency.

### 2. Data Normalization – First Steps
- Learned the concept of data normalization.
- Understood how normalization helps reduce data duplication and improve data integrity.

### 3. Splitting Data Into Tables
- Learned how to divide large tables into smaller, logical tables.
- Understood the importance of separating entities like users, orders, and products.

### 4. Forms Of Data Normalization
- Got introduced to different normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF).
- Learned the basic rules each normal form follows.

### 5. Our First Section Example
- Worked through a practical example to apply normalization concepts.
- Observed how raw data is converted into normalized tables.

### 6. Creating Tables With Relations
- Learned how to create related tables using PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY.
- Understood how relationships are established between tables.

### 7. Inserting Related Data
- Practiced inserting data into tables with relationships.
- Learned the correct order of insertion to maintain referential integrity.

### 8. Joining Data & Introducing INNER JOIN
- Learned what JOINs are and why they are used.
- Introduced to INNER JOIN to combine data from related tables.

### 9. Using INNER JOIN
- Practiced writing INNER JOIN queries.
- Learned how to fetch meaningful combined data from multiple tables.

### 10. Combining Multiple JOINs
- Learned how to join more than two tables in a single query.
- Understood how table relationships work together in complex queries.

### 11. Data Joining & Filtering
- Combined JOINs with WHERE conditions.
- Learned how to filter joined data for precise results.

## Summary
Today’s learning focused on understanding relational databases, data normalization, and joining data across multiple tables using INNER JOINs. This forms the foundation for writing efficient and scalable SQL queries.
