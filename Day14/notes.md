# Day 14 – SQL Functions & Database Practice

## Overview
On Day 14, I worked on strengthening my SQL fundamentals by creating a new database and practicing various built-in SQL functions. The focus was on understanding how mathematical, string, and date/time functions can be applied to real-world data.

---

## Database & Table Creation
- Created a database named **gym**
- Created a table **memberships**
- Inserted sample membership data
- Executed queries to prepare for upcoming operations and analysis

---

## Mathematical Functions Used
Practiced numerical calculations using built-in math functions:
- `CEIL()` – Rounds a number up to the nearest integer
- `FLOOR()` – Rounds a number down to the nearest integer
- `ROUND()` – Rounds a number to a specified decimal place
- `TRUNC()` / `TRUNCATE()` – Removes decimal part without rounding

---

## String Functions Used
Worked with text manipulation and formatting:
- `CONCAT()` – Joins multiple strings
- `LOWER()` – Converts text to lowercase
- `LENGTH()` – Returns the length of a string
- `TRIM()` – Removes leading and trailing spaces
- `||` – String concatenation operator

---

## Date & Time Functions Used
Practiced extracting and converting date/time values:
- `EXTRACT()` – Extracts specific parts of a date (year, month, day, etc.)
- `ISODOW` – Returns ISO day of the week (1–7)
- `CONVERT()` – Converts data from one type to another
- `CAST()` – Explicitly casts a value to a specific data type

---

## Additional Functions
- `WEEKDAY()` – Determines the day of the week from a given date

---

## Key Learnings
- Understood practical usage of SQL functions for data transformation
- Learned how different rounding methods affect numeric results
- Improved handling of string formatting and cleanup
- Gained confidence working with date and time calculations

---

## Outcome
This practice improved my ability to write efficient SQL queries and prepared me for more advanced data analysis and database operations.
