# Day 13 – SQL Advanced Querying & Window Functions

## Overview
On Day 13, I focused on strengthening my understanding of **SQL aggregation, filtering, subqueries, and window functions**.  
The session combined conceptual clarity with hands-on practice using real queries.

## Topics Covered

### 1. GROUP BY Clause
- Understood the purpose of `GROUP BY` in aggregating data.
- Learned how it groups rows based on one or more columns.
- Practiced combining `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, and `AVG()`.

---

### 2. Practical Queries Using JOINS
- Executed queries involving multiple tables using `JOIN`.
- Analyzed how joins work together with grouped and aggregated data.
- Improved understanding of relational data analysis.

### 3. Filters – WHERE vs HAVING
- Learned the difference between `WHERE` and `HAVING`.
- Understood **when and where each filter is applied**:
  - `WHERE` filters rows **before grouping**
  - `HAVING` filters groups **after aggregation**
- Practiced valid and invalid conditions for both clauses.
