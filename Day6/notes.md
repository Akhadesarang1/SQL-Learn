1. Solved a practice solution where i did -
created new DB , added table for product, chose appropriate column name with data types, inserted dummy data into created tables, updated tables and added sensible constraints also added primary key 
2. did both for mysql as well as postgres
3. Had a look into Data Manipulation - CRUD operations
4. Learnt about insert query and inserted multiple data at a same time also inserted false data so update query can work
