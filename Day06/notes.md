# Day 6 – SQL CRUD Operations & Data Manipulation

## Overview
Today focused on hands-on practice of **SQL Data Manipulation Language (DML)** concepts using both **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL**. The goal was to understand CRUD operations through real queries, constraints, and practical data handling.

---

## 1. Database & Table Setup
- Created a new database
- Designed a `product` table
- Chose meaningful column names
- Assigned appropriate data types
- Added a **primary key**
- Applied sensible **constraints** (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE)

---

## 2. Data Insertion (CREATE)
- Inserted **single-row** data
- Inserted **multiple rows** in one query
- Added **intentional incorrect data** to later practice updates

---

## 3. Data Update (UPDATE)
- Used `UPDATE` to correct intentionally wrong data
- Applied conditions using `WHERE`
- Learned the importance of filtering before updating records

---

## 4. Data Deletion (DELETE)
- Used `DELETE` to remove unwanted rows
- Practiced safe deletion using conditions

---

## 5. Data Retrieval (SELECT)
- Wrote multiple `SELECT` queries
- Used **column aliases** for readability
- Applied **data expressions** in queries

---

## 6. Filtering Data
- Understood and practiced filtering using `WHERE`
- Used:
  - Equality and inequality checks
  - Comparison operators: `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
  - Logical operators: `AND`, `OR`

---

## 7. Query Modifiers
- Practiced:
  - `LIMIT`
  - `DISTINCT`
  - `ORDER BY`
  - Sorting using `ASC` and `DESC`

---

## 8. Subqueries & Advanced Filtering
- Wrote **subqueries**
- Combined ordering and limiting
- Filtered text-based data
- Used nested queries for better data control

---

## 9. Cross-Database Practice
- Executed all major queries in:
  - **MySQL**
  - **PostgreSQL**
- Noted syntax consistency and minor differences

---

## Key Takeaways
- CRUD operations form the backbone of SQL data handling
- Filtering is critical for safe updates and deletes
- Writing incorrect data intentionally is useful for learning updates
- Practical execution improves query confidence significantly
