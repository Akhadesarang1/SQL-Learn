## Day 3 – Data Types and Table Design

### Data Types
- Learned key data type categories:
  - **Text**
  - **Numeric**
  - **Date**
  - **Boolean**

### Practical Work
- Learned how to store files in a database by **saving file paths instead of actual files**
- Created tables inside the previously created database
- Added columns step by step:
  - First text column
  - Then numeric value column
- Studied numeric data types in more detail
- Worked with **ENUM** data type and completed table creation
- Created tables in **PostgreSQL** and observed differences from MySQL

### Summary
Day 2 focused on understanding database and table creation using DDL.  
Day 3 focused on data types, table structure, ENUM usage, and hands-on practice in both MySQL and PostgreSQL.
