# Day 01 – SQL Fundamentals & Setup

## Topics Covered
- What SQL is and where it is used
- Relational databases overview
- SQL basic syntax and rules
- Core features of SQL
- Difference between:
  - Data Definition Language (DDL)
  - Data Manipulation Language (DML)
- Installation and setup of:
  - MySQL
  - PostgreSQL
- Connecting to databases using:
  - Command Prompt
  - SQL Shell
- Setting up VS Code with SQLTools extension
- Understanding connection parameters:
  - Host
  - Port
  - Username
  - Password
  - Database
- Creating and managing schemas

## Key Learnings
- SQL is a declarative language used to manage and query relational databases.
- DDL is used to define database structure (CREATE, ALTER, DROP).
- DML is used to manipulate data inside tables (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
- Schemas help organize database objects logically.
- Correct environment setup is critical before writing queries.

## Practical Work Done
- Successfully installed MySQL and PostgreSQL
- Connected to databases via terminal and SQL shell
- Configured SQLTools in VS Code
- Created schemas and verified them
- Revised concepts twice for clarity

## Commands Practiced
- CREATE SCHEMA
- SHOW SCHEMAS / listing schemas
- Connecting to databases using CLI tools

## Notes for Revision
- Be clear on differences between database, schema, and table
- Remember common default ports:
  - MySQL: 3306
  - PostgreSQL: 5432
- Practice schema creation without referring to notes

## Next Day Plan
- SELECT statement
- WHERE clause
- ORDER BY
- LIMIT and DISTINCT
- Write at least 25–30 queries
